# 🌐 Overview

This repository packages **Azure Bicep templates**, **YAML pipelines**, and **operational guidance** for deploying security-focused environments in a repeatable way.

> It is intentionally **generic and redacted** so that you can use it as a **real project skeleton** without exposing sensitive details.

## Goals

- Provide a **clean, reusable starting point** for secure environment deployments.
- Demonstrate **good practices** for documentation, runbooks, and automation.
- Keep the repo **safe to share** (interviews, portfolios, internal templates).

---

## Non-Goals

- Serving as a full landing zone product.
- Encoding organisation-specific standards or names.
- Embedding any secrets, IPs, tenant IDs, or internal URLs.

---

- 📣 **Change / Release Manager** – cares about checklists, approvals, rollbacks.
- 👀 **Reviewer / Interviewer** – wants to see how you structure a serious repo.
